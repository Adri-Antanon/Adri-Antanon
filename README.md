## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm AdriÃ¡n AntaÃ±Ã³n and I love to learn about technology.

Iâ€™m currently learning web applications development (Angular, React, Laravel...), I started studying this in September 19 and I feel that there is an exciting world where I can learn and improve a lot.

So I will update my repository with projects to show my knowledge (and progress) on that technology, feel free to contact me to tell me more optimal ways to code.

If you want to reach me, send a message!

PS: My repositories about the courses I do to learn are at https://gitlab.com/AdrianAntanon, here it is only for projects using that learned knowledge.
