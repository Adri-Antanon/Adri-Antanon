I'm AdriÃ¡n AntaÃ±Ã³n and I love to learn about technology.

Iâ€™m a junior frontend developer working in different projects using some React frameworks or libraries as React or NextJS.

So I will update my repository with projects to show my knowledge (and progress) on that technology, feel free to contact me to tell me more optimal ways to code or collaborate.

You can see a few of my projects in my portfolio https://adrianantanon.netlify.app/

If you want to reach me, send a message!

PS: My repositories about the courses I do to learn are at https://gitlab.com/AdrianAntanon, here it is only for projects using that learned knowledge.
